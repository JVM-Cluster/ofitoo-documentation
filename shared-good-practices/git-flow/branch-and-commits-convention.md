## Branch and Commits convention

Commit should be done according with the following instructions.
If for some reason we push straight to the main branch (Develop)
commits should look like below.

**commit message:** `feat: added a new method to delete users`
1. Commits message are written in lower case, 
    the exceptions are file names that are originally capitalized, e.g. README.md, and abbreviations, e.g. ADR.  

2. Commits message do not end with a dot, but separate parts with commas, e.g. added cube, edited cube.  

3. We write commits message in the past tense; for example: added, edited, deleted, moved, translated, bumped, repaired.  

4. Provide a clear description of what the commit does. Avoid descriptions like "fixed bug" or "updates".  

5. If the commit is related to specific issues or PR, reference them for example, "Fixes #123" or "Closes #456".  

6. Skip unnecessary words like "just", "simply", "actually", "basically" which donâ€™t add value to the commit message.  

if we create a branch based on some user-story.
**branch name:** `feat/20-add-new-a-new-method-to-delete-users`

**ofitoo-doc** is exempt from adding any branch-type due to the nature of the repository,  
everything is **doc/** by default so there is no point in adding it.
